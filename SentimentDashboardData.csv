https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/trump-double-canada-tariffs,"European Commission announces countermeasures after sweeping US levies of 25% come into force without any exemptions Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday “with no exceptions or exemptions”, as his campaign to reorder global trade norms in favor of the US stepped up. The US president’s action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers placed tariffs of 25% on all imports of the metals, which is likely to increase the cost of producing everything from houses to home appliances and vehicles to drinks cans, threatening to raise consumer prices. “It wouldn’t surprise me to see the tariffs pretty quickly show up in prices,” Cato Institute research fellow Clark Packard told AFP. He added that vehicle manufacturing and construction are among the biggest users of steel in the country. The European Commission responded almost immediately to the news, saying it would impose counter tariffs on €26bn ($28bn) worth of US goods from next month. Australian deputy prime minister Richard Marles said on Wednesday the lack of exemptions was “really disappointing”, calling tariffs “an act of kind of economic self-harm”. He told radio station 2GB: “We’ll be able to find other markets for our steel and our aluminium and we have been diversifying those markets.” The run-up to the tariff deadline came with some drama on Tuesday after Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum after Canadian threats to increase electricity prices for US customers. The US president backed off those plans after Ontario premier Doug Ford agreed to suspend his province’s decision to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York. Ford said he would fly to Washington on Thursday with Canadian finance minister Dominic LeBlanc for talks with US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump officials to discuss revising the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. The acrimony set off another stock market sell-off on Wall Street that was only tempered when Ford said he had made a deal with Lutnick. Trump has also threatened more tariffs on 2 April on the car industry that would “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada”. Asking rhetorically why the US received electricity from another country, he accused Canada of using energy, “that so affects the life of innocent people, as a bargaining chip and threat” and said “they will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come”. Mark Carney, Canada’s incoming prime minister, called Trump’s latest move “an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses” and promised to “keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade”. The Trump administration was also reportedly preparing on Tuesday to institute a new rule that would require some Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register personal information and agree to fingerprinting, according to Bloomberg. Currently there is largely frictionless travel for citizens between the two countries. The fractious economic battle between the US and Canada has developed even graver undertones as Trump makes increasingly aggressive threats for the US to absorb its northern neighbour. Although at first claiming that he wanted Canada to crack down on fentanyl, Trump has now accused the US ally of underpaying for military protection and incorrectly described the trade imbalance with Canada as a $200bn subsidy from the US. Trump coupled his tariff declaration with openly aggressive language about making Canada “our cherished Fifty First State”, repeating a constant refrain over the last few months. He claimed American statehood for Canada would make “all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear”, called the border “an artificial line of separation drawn many years ago” and suggested the Canadian national anthem, O Canada, would become a state anthem. The rhetoric has inspired a rare unity among Canadian politicians, with Carney campaigning for Liberal leader on standing up to Trump, and saying to a standing ovation in his acceptance speech on Sunday that “Canada never, ever will be part of America”. Trump’s moves are just the latest in the chaos around the president’s trade policy, amid tumbling stock markets and fears it could trigger a possible US recession. The White House’s strategy so far has been to play down the anxiety on Wall Street, even as stocks waver. After Trump refused to rule out the possibility of a recession in an interview with Fox News over the weekend, the Nasdaq had its worst day on Monday since September 2022, dropping 4%. Shares in US automakers also fell after the announcement, as traders bet that high metal tariffs would drive up costs for the American industrial sector, eating into their profits. Ford Motor dropped nearly 4%, while General Motors dipped by 1.3%. Shares in the carmaker Stellantis – which has several manufacturing facilities in Canada – fell by more than 5%. Price premiums for aluminum on US physical market soared to a record high above $990 a metric ton, Reuters reported. The Ontario premier Ford has said that Trump must take the blame if there is a recession in the US, telling MSNBC on Tuesday: “If we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.” Ford has said in the past that he would be willing to cut off US energy supply from Ontario completely in response to Trump’s tariffs. “We will be relentless,” Ford said, adding he would not “hesitate” to shut off electricity exports to the US if Trump continues the trade war.
 “That’s the last thing I want to do. I want to send more electricity down to the US, to our closest allies or our best neighbors in the world. I want to send more electricity.” But, he said, “Is it a tool in our toolkit? One hundred per cent, and as he continues to hurt Canadian families, Ontario families, I won’t hesitate to do that.” Ford also encouraged American CEOs, who have been largely silent on the trade war and threats to Canadian sovereignty, to speak up. On Tuesday Trump is set to meet with the Business Roundtable, an influential group of business leaders that includes the CEOs of Google, Amazon and JPMorgan. Ford said: “We need those CEOs to actually get a backbone and stand in front of him and tell him, ‘This is going to be a disaster. It’s mass chaos right now.’” The group said in a statement last week that while it supported trade policies that “open markets to US exports, revitalize the domestic manufacturing base and de-risk supply chains”, it called on the White House to “preserve the benefits” of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump himself signed in 2020 but has since apparently violated by suddenly imposing steep tariffs on both countries. Both consumer and business confidence has dropped in the US since Trump entered office. A survey published on Monday in Chief Executive magazine found that CEOs’ rating of the current business climate fell 20% in January, from 6.3 out of 10 – with 1 being “poor” and 10 being “excellent” – to 5, the lowest since spring 2020. 
  Meanwhile, consumer confidence measured by the Conference Board found that confidence dropped over 6% in February, its biggest month-to-month drop since August 2021. Trump had not yet spoken with Carney, said the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, arguing that the tariffs on Canadian metals “was a retaliatory statement due to the escalation of rhetoric that we’ve seen out of Ontario, Canada”. “I think Canada is a neighbor. They are a partner. They have always been an ally,” she said, adding: “Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now.”  This article was amended on 13 March 2025. An earlier version said that Doug Ford had stated he “would be willing to cut off US energy supply from Canada completely in response to Trump’s tariffs”; that should have said Ontario, not Canada.",Canada,Neutral

(Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press via AP)               WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is again lashing out at three of his biggest irritants: foreign steel, foreign aluminum and Canada.  The Trump administration on Wednesday will effectively plaster 25% taxes – tariffs – on all steel and aluminum imports. The president said on Tuesday that the U.S. would double the forthcoming levy on the two metals to 50% if they come from Canada — but pulled back on the threat by the afternoon after the province of Ontario suspended its plans for retaliatory tariffs. Cars sit parked outside the United States Steel Corporations Edgar Thomson Plant in Braddock, Pa., on Tuesday, March 4, 2025, in Braddock, Pa. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)   The pain won’t just be felt by foreign steel and aluminum plants. The tariffs will likely drive up costs for American companies that use the metals, such as automakers, construction firms and beverage makers that use cans. The threats to the economy have rattled stock markets.   “Unilateral tariffs will raise prices, cost American jobs, and strain alliances,” Philip Luck and Evan Brown of the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in a report last month.   President Donald Trump pumps his fist before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, March 7, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)   The latest tariffs are an amped-up replay from Trump’s first term.  In 2018, in an effort to protect American steelmakers from foreign competition, he imposed tariffs of 25% on foreign steel and 10% on aluminum, using a 1962 trade law to declare them a threat to U.S. national security.  The tariffs landed most heavily on American allies: Canada is the No. 1 supplier of foreign steel and accounts for more than half of aluminum exports to the United States. Mexico, Japan and South Korea are also major steel exporters to the U.S. 
  The president insists that steel imports are a threat to the very existence of the United States. “If we don’t have, as an example, steel, and lots of other things, we don’t have a military and frankly we won’t have — we just won’t have a country very long,” Trump said last week in his joint address to Congress.  His 2018 sanctions were gradually watered down.  Trump spared Canada and Mexico after they agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020. For some U.S. trading partners, the tariffs were supplanted by import quotas. And the first Trump administration also allowed American companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn’t find the steel they needed from domestic U.S. producers.  This time, Trump is closing those loopholes and raising the levy on aluminum to 25%.   He’s shown a willingness to go higher — as the apparently short-lived 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum suggest.  Trump was originally punching back at the government of Ontario for imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity sold to the United States, a move that was itself a response to Trump’s tariff threats. After Trump said he’d hit the Canadians with a 50% metals tax, Ontario suspended its planned electricity surcharge. In response, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the U.S. would pull back on doubling the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.     Coils of steel are seen at the ArcelorMittal Dofasco Steel Plant in Hamilton, Ontario, Friday, Feb. 14, 2025. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press via AP)   Trump’s first-term steel and aluminum tariffs benefited American producers of the two metals, encouraging them to increase production. But the beneficiaries were relatively few: The U.S. steel industry, for instance, employs fewer than 150,000 people. Walmart alone has 1.6 million employees in the United States.  Moreover, economists have found, the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on “downstream’’ manufacturers that use steel and aluminum. In 2021, production at such companies dropped by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs, canceling out the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.  This time, “there is no particular reason to think that the economics won’t be more of the same: small gains for the U.S. steel and aluminum producers and employees, but larger overall losses for the rest of U..S manufacturing,’’ said Christine McDaniel, research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.  Taken by themselves, the metals tariffs are unlikely to do much damage to the nearly $30 trillion U.S. economy. “Steel and aluminum – they’re just a drop in the ocean,’’ said Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist at S&P Global Ratings.  But Trump isn’t just hitting steel and aluminum. He’s slapped 20% tariffs on all Chinese imports. He’s set to hammer all Canadian and Mexican products with 25% taxes next month, while limiting the tariff on Canadian energy to 10% – moves he has twice postponed with 30-day reprieves. And he has an ambitious and complicated plan to impose “reciprocal tariffs,’’ raising U.S. import taxes to match those of countries that impose higher levies on American products.  The scope and unpredictability of Trump’s tariff agenda threatens to rekindle inflation and to slow growth by discouraging companies from making investments until the trade tensions have eased. “If you’re an executive in the board room, are you really going to tell your board it’s the time to expand that assembly line?” said John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.    A board above the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange shows the closing number for the Dow Jones industrial average, Tuesday, March 11, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)   U.S. steelmakers can step up production to offset lost imports. They can also raise prices – and have already started, putting U.S. companies that use American steel at a disadvantage to competitors who get theirs elsewhere.  U.S. steel was priced at $854 per metric ton as of Feb. 24, considerably higher than the average world export price of $488, according to Steel Benchmarker.  Aluminum is a different story. The United States has just four aluminum smelters and only two of them were fully operating last year. Increasing U.S. smelter production would require “enough power for a small city,” S&P Global said in a report last week.  Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs quickly drew retaliation. The European Union imposed new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products. The EU measures will cover U.S. imports worth around $28 billion (26 billion euros) and include not only steel and aluminum but textile, home appliances and farm products. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will also be hit, as they were during Trump’s first term.   Canada plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on almost $21 billion (nearly Canadian $30 billion) of U.S. exports, a senior Canadian government official said Wednesday. The official wasn’t authorized to speak before the announcement and spoke on the condition of anonymity.    Critics say Trump’s metals tariffs are hitting the wrong target.  China is widely seen as a source of the world steel industry’s problems. Chinese overproduction, heavily subsidized by Beijing, has flooded the world with steel and kept prices low, hurting steelmakers in the United States and elsewhere.  But the U.S. already uses trade barriers to keep out most Chinese steel. China accounted for less than 2% of U.S. steel imports last year, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. “Instead of focusing on the real issue — China’s market-distorting policies — the United States risks entangling itself in tariff disputes with its closest allies,’’ wrote Luck and Brown at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  Meanwhile, companies that use steel are already feeling the pain.

(Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press via AP)   Steelport Knife Co. in Portland, Oregon, uses U.S. steel in its knives for home cooks and professional chefs. Last month, its American steel supplier, anticipating Trump’s tariffs, raised its price by 10%.  CEO Ron Khormaei says Steelport’s Japanese and German competitors are benefiting. “It’s cheaper for them,’’ he said. Khormaei says his small company — it has 12 employees — will lose business if it raises prices. So he’s doing everything he can to cut costs — keeping inventories tight, for example, and limiting travel to trade shows.  And he’s facing another problem. “Canadians are mad at us,’’ he said.  Khormaei said that one of his Canadian customers just cancelled an order by email: “Thank you. We love your product. We are not buying.’’   Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this story.

https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum-top-countries-us-imports-2025-2,"President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports began Wednesday — a move that is likely to make building construction and car assembly more expensive. The levies come as Trump doubles down on his second-term tariff agenda and applies to all imports of the two metals entering the US. The White House has introduced and walked back a series of measures against China, Mexico, and Canada in recent weeks, causing economic uncertainty in US markets.  On March 11, Trump threatened to up the Canadian steel and aluminum tariff to 50%, before dropping it back down to 25%. While Trump reversed those further tariff hikes, American consumers are still likely to feel the 25% levy on metals. Census Bureau data showed Canada, Mexico, and Brazil were the main suppliers of steel and iron imports to the US in 2024 by dollar value. Iron can be used to produce steel. In 2024, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, and Mexico were the main countries behind US imports of aluminum and bauxite — a material used to create aluminum — by dollar value. One of Trump's main goals early in his second term has been limiting foreign trade with an eye toward bolstering domestic industries. Many economists have said the brunt of tariffs could fall on American consumers. With the new steel and aluminum tariffs, Americans can expect various consumer goods, like pipes and cooking utensils, to become more expensive because of lower supply, higher demand, and steeper import costs. The travel and construction industries are also likely to be affected. Aluminum is primarily used to manufacture automobiles, airplanes, kitchen appliances, cans, and electrical transmission lines, per the US Geological Survey. Steel is also used in automobile production, as well as in the construction of bridges, buildings, and homes. The metals tariffs follow new 10% tariffs that were implemented on China, which quickly retaliated with a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and some vehicles. Additionally, the White House delayed a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico after Trump made a deal with the nations' leaders on border-protection measures. Trump's plan for metal tariffs also come after other big news in the steel industry. Japan's Nippon Steel announced last month that it would drop its nearly $15 billion acquisition bid for US Steel, ending a yearslong battle over American steel production. Nippon Steel said it would instead ""invest heavily"" in US Steel. The president's new focus on metals tariffs shouldn't come as a surprise. During his first term in office, he imposed a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum. He later granted some duty-free exemptions to top trade partners such as Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. It's not clear whether he will do the same this time around. The Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jump to",Canada,Negative
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/trump-tariffs-recession-poll,"Exclusive: 90% of Democrats, 57% of Republicans are worried about tariffs, with similar concerns about recession Americans are increasingly concerned about Donald Trump’s effort to overhaul the US economy with sweeping tariffs on foreign goods, according to an exclusive poll for the Guardian, despite the US president’s efforts to downplay the risks of his strategy. “Have no fear, we will WIN everything!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday, claiming that tariffs were already “pouring money” into the country. But fears are growing. When given a list of issues including inflation, healthcare and immigration, 72% of Americans said they are concerned about tariffs. The survey was conducted by the Harris Poll in early March. When it conducted the same survey in mid-January, 61% of those polled said tariffs were a concern. A lot has changed since then. Since returning to the White House, Trump has pushed for tariffs against many of the US’s key trading partners. He tacked on an extra 20% tariff on Chinese imports and hiked tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. The president has also threatened to go further next month, promising sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on all imports from across the world and universal tariffs on all products imported from Canada and Mexico. Amid widespread concerns, Trump and his cabinet have spent the last few weeks arguing that this strategy will bring jobs back to the US and ultimately lead to higher wages. The commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, conceded last week that a recession was possible, but suggested this would be “worth it”. But so far, most Americans seem skeptical of this vision: 66% believe the US economy will take years to recover from Trump’s tariffs, according to the survey. The country remains divided. As shown in recent polling, how a person views the economy under Trump depends on their political party. Republicans were less likely than Democrats and independents to be concerned about the economy and inflation, a potential recession and tariffs. 90% of Democrats and 69% of independents said they are concerned about tariffs, compared to 57% of Republicans. 89% of Democrats and 75% of independents said they are concerned about a potential recession in the US, compared to 65% of Republicans. 85% of Democrats and 62% of independents said it will take years for the US economy to recover from the tariffs, compared with 52% of Republicans. It’s a sudden flip from how Republicans and Democrats viewed the economy last year while Joe Biden was president. Last May, 70% of Republicans said the economy was worsening, compared with 26% who indicated the same last month. Comparatively, 69% of Democrats now say the economy is getting worse, compared with 36% who said the same in May. This is also reflected in whether someone believes the tariffs against Canada and Mexico are justified. The vast majority of Republicans believe that the tariffs are justified – 79% for tariffs against Mexico, and 75% for tariffs against Canada – while just over 30% for Democrats and about 40% of independents believe the same. Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Americans across the board are still worried about the cost of living. Most Democrats (91%) and independents (88%), along with 82% of Republicans, said that they are concerned about the economy and inflation. Similar majorities said that they are concerned about being able to afford their living expenses. The Trump administration has only doubled down on its strategy, and threatened more tariffs, in response to retaliatory tariffs against American exports. When Ontario threatened tariffs on electricity exports to the US last week, Trump said he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada to 50%. Only after Ontario said it would drop its tariffs did Trump concede. After the EU put a retaliatory tariff on $28bn worth of American exports, including a 50% tax on American bourbon exports, Trump said he would put a 200% tariff on European alcohol imports. Trump’s insistence on tariffs comes in defiance of growing concerns that the policies could ultimately lead to a recession. The uncertainty has shaken Wall Street, which has had a turbulent last few weeks, despite recent better-than-expected data reports on the labor market and inflation that showed general stability in the economy. Something that most people agree on, regardless of party: a majority (59%) believe that the tariffs won’t last long. That includes 61% of Republicans, 60% of Democrats and 55% of independents. “Most Americans are of the sentiment that ‘this too shall pass’,” said John Gerzema, CEO of Harris Poll. “But there’s growing concern that tariffs could have a lasting and unknowable impact on the economy, regardless of whether they’re walked back soon or not.”",Canada,Neutral

Carney, an economist who succeeded Justin Trudeau as both prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party earlier in March, made the remarks as he called for a snap election on April 28. The relationship between the two countries has continued to hit lows as Trump has put into place 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico, with exceptions for goods traded under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Trump has also placed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports and has plans to issue a series of retaliatory tariffs on April 2.

""President Trump claims that Canada isn't a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us,"" he continued. ""We will not let that happen. We need to build the strongest economy in the G7."" Carney's call for an election wasn't unexpected, as he lacks a seat in Parliament, and his Liberal Party lacks a majority in the legislature. However, Carney will run for a seat in the Nepean area of Ottawa.

Prime Minister Mark Carney holds a press conference following the First Ministers Meeting at the National War Museum on Friday, March 21, 2025. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP) TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday U.S. President Donald Trump will ultimately respect Canada’s sovereignty and be ready for comprehensive trade talks because Americans are going to suffer from Trump’s trade war.  Carney said talks with Trump will not happen “until we get the respect we deserve as a sovereign nation. By the way, this is not a high bar.” Trump kept up his near-daily attacks on Canada on Friday, repeating that the country should be the 51st state and that the U.S. keeps Canada “afloat.”  “When I say they should be a state, I mean that,” the American president said.  Carney met with Canada’s provincial leaders at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, where he announced relief packages for workers and businesses hurt by the trade war and announced moves to expedite resource projects.  Carney, sworn in last Friday, still hasn’t had a phone call with Trump. Trump mocked Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, by calling him Governor Trudeau, but he has not yet mentioned Carney’s name.  The new prime minister said he wants a comprehensive discussion on trade and security with the Americans and not a one-off tariff discussion.  “In the end, Americans are going to lose from American trade action and that’s one of the reasons I am confident that there will be that discussion with the appropriate amount of respect and the breadth,” Carney said. “I am ready for it anytime they are ready.” 
 Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products as well as all of America’s trading partners on April 2.  Carney became Prime Minister after winning a Liberal Party leadership race triggered by Trudeau’s decision to step down earlier this year. He’s expected to trigger the process for early parliamentary elections this Sunday, with a vote expected before April 28. The governing Liberals appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war and upended Canadian politics.  The almost daily attacks on Canada’s sovereignty have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips south of the border and avoiding buying American goods when they can. The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered Liberal poll numbers.  Carney said the premiers of Canada’s provinces had agreed to work on a plan to develop a national trade and energy corridor in an effort to diversify trade.  He said that could mean a oil pipeline from oil-rich Alberta to Eastern Canada. Quebec has previously opposed a pipeline, but Premier François Legault now says opinions are changing because of Trump’s threats. Carney said Quebec uses about 350,000 barrels of oil daily and 70% of that comes from the U.S.  “That is not a good idea for us at all. So there is an opportunity to put a pipeline there but we need social acceptance. We need a partnership with indigenous people as well,” Carney said.  He said the federal government would speed up projects by recognizing provincial assessments. Canadian leaders also talked about about moving quickly to eliminate trade barriers between provinces and with the federal government. Carney also said Ottawa is also going to waive the one-week waiting period to get employment insurance for people whose jobs are cut because of the tariffs, and temporarily allow Canadian businesses to defer income tax and sales tax payments to help boost their liquidity.

Mark Carney, Canada’s incoming prime minister, called Trump’s latest move “an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses” and promised to “keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade”. The Trump administration was also reportedly preparing on Tuesday to institute a new rule that would require some Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register personal information and agree to fingerprinting, according to Bloomberg. Currently there is largely frictionless travel for citizens between the two countries. The fractious economic battle between the US and Canada has developed even graver undertones as Trump makes increasingly aggressive threats for the US to absorb its northern neighbour. Although at first claiming that he wanted Canada to crack down on fentanyl, Trump has now accused the US ally of underpaying for military protection and incorrectly described the trade imbalance with Canada as a $200bn subsidy from the US. Trump coupled his tariff declaration with openly aggressive language about making Canada “our cherished Fifty First State”, repeating a constant refrain over the last few months. He claimed American statehood for Canada would make “all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear”, called the border “an artificial line of separation drawn many years ago” and suggested the Canadian national anthem, O Canada, would become a state anthem. The rhetoric has inspired a rare unity among Canadian politicians, with Carney campaigning for Liberal leader on standing up to Trump, and saying to a standing ovation in his acceptance speech on Sunday that “Canada never, ever will be part of America”. Trump’s moves are just the latest in the chaos around the president’s trade policy, amid tumbling stock markets and fears it could trigger a possible US recession. The White House’s strategy so far has been to play down the anxiety on Wall Street, even as stocks waver. After Trump refused to rule out the possibility of a recession in an interview with Fox News over the weekend, the Nasdaq had its worst day on Monday since September 2022, dropping 4%. Shares in US automakers also fell after the announcement, as traders bet that high metal tariffs would drive up costs for the American industrial sector, eating into their profits. Ford Motor dropped nearly 4%, while General Motors dipped by 1.3%. Shares in the carmaker Stellantis – which has several manufacturing facilities in Canada – fell by more than 5%. Price premiums for aluminum on US physical market soared to a record high above $990 a metric ton, Reuters reported. The Ontario premier Ford has said that Trump must take the blame if there is a recession in the US, telling MSNBC on Tuesday: “If we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.” Ford has said in the past that he would be willing to cut off US energy supply from Ontario completely in response to Trump’s tariffs. “We will be relentless,” Ford said, adding he would not “hesitate” to shut off electricity exports to the US if Trump continues the trade war.
 “That’s the last thing I want to do. I want to send more electricity down to the US, to our closest allies or our best neighbors in the world. I want to send more electricity.” But, he said, “Is it a tool in our toolkit? One hundred per cent, and as he continues to hurt Canadian families, Ontario families, I won’t hesitate to do that.” Ford also encouraged American CEOs, who have been largely silent on the trade war and threats to Canadian sovereignty, to speak up. On Tuesday Trump is set to meet with the Business Roundtable, an influential group of business leaders that includes the CEOs of Google, Amazon and JPMorgan. Ford said: “We need those CEOs to actually get a backbone and stand in front of him and tell him, ‘This is going to be a disaster. It’s mass chaos right now.’” The group said in a statement last week that while it supported trade policies that “open markets to US exports, revitalize the domestic manufacturing base and de-risk supply chains”, it called on the White House to “preserve the benefits” of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump himself signed in 2020 but has since apparently violated by suddenly imposing steep tariffs on both countries. Both consumer and business confidence has dropped in the US since Trump entered office. A survey published on Monday in Chief Executive magazine found that CEOs’ rating of the current business climate fell 20% in January, from 6.3 out of 10 – with 1 being “poor” and 10 being “excellent” – to 5, the lowest since spring 2020. 
  Meanwhile, consumer confidence measured by the Conference Board found that confidence dropped over 6% in February, its biggest month-to-month drop since August 2021. Trump had not yet spoken with Carney, said the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, arguing that the tariffs on Canadian metals “was a retaliatory statement due to the escalation of rhetoric that we’ve seen out of Ontario, Canada”. “I think Canada is a neighbor. They are a partner. They have always been an ally,” she said, adding: “Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now.”  This article was amended on 13 March 2025. An earlier version said that Doug Ford had stated he “would be willing to cut off US energy supply from Canada completely in response to Trump’s tariffs”; that should have said Ontario, not Canada.",Canada,Neutral

(Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press via AP)               WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is again lashing out at three of his biggest irritants: foreign steel, foreign aluminum and Canada.  The Trump administration on Wednesday will effectively plaster 25% taxes – tariffs – on all steel and aluminum imports. The president said on Tuesday that the U.S. would double the forthcoming levy on the two metals to 50% if they come from Canada — but pulled back on the threat by the afternoon after the province of Ontario suspended its plans for retaliatory tariffs. Cars sit parked outside the United States Steel Corporations Edgar Thomson Plant in Braddock, Pa., on Tuesday, March 4, 2025, in Braddock, Pa. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)   The pain won’t just be felt by foreign steel and aluminum plants. The tariffs will likely drive up costs for American companies that use the metals, such as automakers, construction firms and beverage makers that use cans. The threats to the economy have rattled stock markets.   “Unilateral tariffs will raise prices, cost American jobs, and strain alliances,” Philip Luck and Evan Brown of the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in a report last month.   President Donald Trump pumps his fist before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, March 7, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)   The latest tariffs are an amped-up replay from Trump’s first term.  In 2018, in an effort to protect American steelmakers from foreign competition, he imposed tariffs of 25% on foreign steel and 10% on aluminum, using a 1962 trade law to declare them a threat to U.S. national security.  The tariffs landed most heavily on American allies: Canada is the No. 1 supplier of foreign steel and accounts for more than half of aluminum exports to the United States. Mexico, Japan and South Korea are also major steel exporters to the U.S. 
  The president insists that steel imports are a threat to the very existence of the United States. “If we don’t have, as an example, steel, and lots of other things, we don’t have a military and frankly we won’t have — we just won’t have a country very long,” Trump said last week in his joint address to Congress.  His 2018 sanctions were gradually watered down.  Trump spared Canada and Mexico after they agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020. For some U.S. trading partners, the tariffs were supplanted by import quotas. And the first Trump administration also allowed American companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn’t find the steel they needed from domestic U.S. producers.  This time, Trump is closing those loopholes and raising the levy on aluminum to 25%.   He’s shown a willingness to go higher — as the apparently short-lived 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum suggest.  Trump was originally punching back at the government of Ontario for imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity sold to the United States, a move that was itself a response to Trump’s tariff threats. After Trump said he’d hit the Canadians with a 50% metals tax, Ontario suspended its planned electricity surcharge. In response, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the U.S. would pull back on doubling the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.     Coils of steel are seen at the ArcelorMittal Dofasco Steel Plant in Hamilton, Ontario, Friday, Feb. 14, 2025. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press via AP)   Trump’s first-term steel and aluminum tariffs benefited American producers of the two metals, encouraging them to increase production. But the beneficiaries were relatively few: The U.S. steel industry, for instance, employs fewer than 150,000 people. Walmart alone has 1.6 million employees in the United States.  Moreover, economists have found, the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on “downstream’’ manufacturers that use steel and aluminum. In 2021, production at such companies dropped by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs, canceling out the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.  This time, “there is no particular reason to think that the economics won’t be more of the same: small gains for the U.S. steel and aluminum producers and employees, but larger overall losses for the rest of U..S manufacturing,’’ said Christine McDaniel, research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.  Taken by themselves, the metals tariffs are unlikely to do much damage to the nearly $30 trillion U.S. economy. “Steel and aluminum – they’re just a drop in the ocean,’’ said Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist at S&P Global Ratings.  But Trump isn’t just hitting steel and aluminum. He’s slapped 20% tariffs on all Chinese imports. He’s set to hammer all Canadian and Mexican products with 25% taxes next month, while limiting the tariff on Canadian energy to 10% – moves he has twice postponed with 30-day reprieves. And he has an ambitious and complicated plan to impose “reciprocal tariffs,’’ raising U.S. import taxes to match those of countries that impose higher levies on American products.  The scope and unpredictability of Trump’s tariff agenda threatens to rekindle inflation and to slow growth by discouraging companies from making investments until the trade tensions have eased. “If you’re an executive in the board room, are you really going to tell your board it’s the time to expand that assembly line?” said John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.    A board above the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange shows the closing number for the Dow Jones industrial average, Tuesday, March 11, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)   U.S. steelmakers can step up production to offset lost imports. They can also raise prices – and have already started, putting U.S. companies that use American steel at a disadvantage to competitors who get theirs elsewhere.  U.S. steel was priced at $854 per metric ton as of Feb. 24, considerably higher than the average world export price of $488, according to Steel Benchmarker.  Aluminum is a different story. The United States has just four aluminum smelters and only two of them were fully operating last year. Increasing U.S. smelter production would require “enough power for a small city,” S&P Global said in a report last week.  Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs quickly drew retaliation. The European Union imposed new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products. The EU measures will cover U.S. imports worth around $28 billion (26 billion euros) and include not only steel and aluminum but textile, home appliances and farm products. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will also be hit, as they were during Trump’s first term.   Canada plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on almost $21 billion (nearly Canadian $30 billion) of U.S. exports, a senior Canadian government official said Wednesday. The official wasn’t authorized to speak before the announcement and spoke on the condition of anonymity.    Critics say Trump’s metals tariffs are hitting the wrong target.  China is widely seen as a source of the world steel industry’s problems. Chinese overproduction, heavily subsidized by Beijing, has flooded the world with steel and kept prices low, hurting steelmakers in the United States and elsewhere.  But the U.S. already uses trade barriers to keep out most Chinese steel. China accounted for less than 2% of U.S. steel imports last year, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. “Instead of focusing on the real issue — China’s market-distorting policies — the United States risks entangling itself in tariff disputes with its closest allies,’’ wrote Luck and Brown at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  Meanwhile, companies that use steel are already feeling the pain.

(Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press via AP)   Steelport Knife Co. in Portland, Oregon, uses U.S. steel in its knives for home cooks and professional chefs. Last month, its American steel supplier, anticipating Trump’s tariffs, raised its price by 10%.  CEO Ron Khormaei says Steelport’s Japanese and German competitors are benefiting. “It’s cheaper for them,’’ he said. Khormaei says his small company — it has 12 employees — will lose business if it raises prices. So he’s doing everything he can to cut costs — keeping inventories tight, for example, and limiting travel to trade shows.  And he’s facing another problem. “Canadians are mad at us,’’ he said.  Khormaei said that one of his Canadian customers just cancelled an order by email: “Thank you. We love your product. We are not buying.’’   Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this story.

https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum-top-countries-us-imports-2025-2,"President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports began Wednesday — a move that is likely to make building construction and car assembly more expensive. The levies come as Trump doubles down on his second-term tariff agenda and applies to all imports of the two metals entering the US. The White House has introduced and walked back a series of measures against China, Mexico, and Canada in recent weeks, causing economic uncertainty in US markets.  On March 11, Trump threatened to up the Canadian steel and aluminum tariff to 50%, before dropping it back down to 25%. While Trump reversed those further tariff hikes, American consumers are still likely to feel the 25% levy on metals. Census Bureau data showed Canada, Mexico, and Brazil were the main suppliers of steel and iron imports to the US in 2024 by dollar value. Iron can be used to produce steel. In 2024, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, and Mexico were the main countries behind US imports of aluminum and bauxite — a material used to create aluminum — by dollar value. One of Trump's main goals early in his second term has been limiting foreign trade with an eye toward bolstering domestic industries. Many economists have said the brunt of tariffs could fall on American consumers. With the new steel and aluminum tariffs, Americans can expect various consumer goods, like pipes and cooking utensils, to become more expensive because of lower supply, higher demand, and steeper import costs. The travel and construction industries are also likely to be affected. Aluminum is primarily used to manufacture automobiles, airplanes, kitchen appliances, cans, and electrical transmission lines, per the US Geological Survey. Steel is also used in automobile production, as well as in the construction of bridges, buildings, and homes. The metals tariffs follow new 10% tariffs that were implemented on China, which quickly retaliated with a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and some vehicles. Additionally, the White House delayed a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico after Trump made a deal with the nations' leaders on border-protection measures. Trump's plan for metal tariffs also come after other big news in the steel industry. Japan's Nippon Steel announced last month that it would drop its nearly $15 billion acquisition bid for US Steel, ending a yearslong battle over American steel production. Nippon Steel said it would instead ""invest heavily"" in US Steel. The president's new focus on metals tariffs shouldn't come as a surprise. During his first term in office, he imposed a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum. He later granted some duty-free exemptions to top trade partners such as Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. It's not clear whether he will do the same this time around. The Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jump to",USA,Negative
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/trump-tariffs-recession-poll,"Exclusive: 90% of Democrats, 57% of Republicans are worried about tariffs, with similar concerns about recession Americans are increasingly concerned about Donald Trump’s effort to overhaul the US economy with sweeping tariffs on foreign goods, according to an exclusive poll for the Guardian, despite the US president’s efforts to downplay the risks of his strategy. “Have no fear, we will WIN everything!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday, claiming that tariffs were already “pouring money” into the country. But fears are growing. When given a list of issues including inflation, healthcare and immigration, 72% of Americans said they are concerned about tariffs. The survey was conducted by the Harris Poll in early March. When it conducted the same survey in mid-January, 61% of those polled said tariffs were a concern. A lot has changed since then. Since returning to the White House, Trump has pushed for tariffs against many of the US’s key trading partners. He tacked on an extra 20% tariff on Chinese imports and hiked tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. The president has also threatened to go further next month, promising sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on all imports from across the world and universal tariffs on all products imported from Canada and Mexico. Amid widespread concerns, Trump and his cabinet have spent the last few weeks arguing that this strategy will bring jobs back to the US and ultimately lead to higher wages. The commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, conceded last week that a recession was possible, but suggested this would be “worth it”. But so far, most Americans seem skeptical of this vision: 66% believe the US economy will take years to recover from Trump’s tariffs, according to the survey. The country remains divided. As shown in recent polling, how a person views the economy under Trump depends on their political party. Republicans were less likely than Democrats and independents to be concerned about the economy and inflation, a potential recession and tariffs. 90% of Democrats and 69% of independents said they are concerned about tariffs, compared to 57% of Republicans. 89% of Democrats and 75% of independents said they are concerned about a potential recession in the US, compared to 65% of Republicans. 85% of Democrats and 62% of independents said it will take years for the US economy to recover from the tariffs, compared with 52% of Republicans. It’s a sudden flip from how Republicans and Democrats viewed the economy last year while Joe Biden was president. Last May, 70% of Republicans said the economy was worsening, compared with 26% who indicated the same last month. Comparatively, 69% of Democrats now say the economy is getting worse, compared with 36% who said the same in May. This is also reflected in whether someone believes the tariffs against Canada and Mexico are justified. The vast majority of Republicans believe that the tariffs are justified – 79% for tariffs against Mexico, and 75% for tariffs against Canada – while just over 30% for Democrats and about 40% of independents believe the same. Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Americans across the board are still worried about the cost of living. Most Democrats (91%) and independents (88%), along with 82% of Republicans, said that they are concerned about the economy and inflation. Similar majorities said that they are concerned about being able to afford their living expenses. The Trump administration has only doubled down on its strategy, and threatened more tariffs, in response to retaliatory tariffs against American exports. When Ontario threatened tariffs on electricity exports to the US last week, Trump said he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada to 50%. Only after Ontario said it would drop its tariffs did Trump concede. After the EU put a retaliatory tariff on $28bn worth of American exports, including a 50% tax on American bourbon exports, Trump said he would put a 200% tariff on European alcohol imports. Trump’s insistence on tariffs comes in defiance of growing concerns that the policies could ultimately lead to a recession. The uncertainty has shaken Wall Street, which has had a turbulent last few weeks, despite recent better-than-expected data reports on the labor market and inflation that showed general stability in the economy. Something that most people agree on, regardless of party: a majority (59%) believe that the tariffs won’t last long. That includes 61% of Republicans, 60% of Democrats and 55% of independents. “Most Americans are of the sentiment that ‘this too shall pass’,” said John Gerzema, CEO of Harris Poll. “But there’s growing concern that tariffs could have a lasting and unknowable impact on the economy, regardless of whether they’re walked back soon or not.”",USA,Neutral

https://www.businessinsider.com/canada-carney-trump-snap-election-trade-2025-3,"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Sunday said President Donald Trump won't ""break"" his country and pushed back against what he said were ""unjustified trade actions"" from the United States. Carney, an economist who succeeded Justin Trudeau as both prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party earlier in March, made the remarks as he called for a snap election on April 28. The relationship between the two countries has continued to hit lows as Trump has put into place 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico, with exceptions for goods traded under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Trump has also placed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports and has plans to issue a series of retaliatory tariffs on April 2. ""We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,"" Carney said, referencing Trump's calls for Canada to become the 51st US state. ""President Trump claims that Canada isn't a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us,"" he continued. ""We will not let that happen. We need to build the strongest economy in the G7."" Carney's call for an election wasn't unexpected, as he lacks a seat in Parliament, and his Liberal Party lacks a majority in the legislature. However, Carney will run for a seat in the Nepean area of Ottawa. And the Liberal Party, which had sunk in popularity in recent years, has seen a significant turnaround in support for the upcoming election. Carney has now put into motion a five-week campaign where he'll compete against the Conservative Party and its leader, Pierre Poilievre. Jump to",USA,Negative
